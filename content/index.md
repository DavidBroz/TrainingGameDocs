## Introduction
### Game Summary Pitch

Tetris is just a another version of classic game Tetris with reduced game mechanics for easier implementation. This game is created as a test of game development coordination of Pinguanec, wuchta, Zettexe, and Omnivert.

## Inspiration

### Tetris
We are taking inspiration from 2D versions of Tetris. We aim to quickly implement the basic mechanics of the Tetris game without any advanced features. The goal is to have achieve the basic game loop of putting down block and clearing rows.

### **Player Experience**

In a chill pace the player will be placing the block on the board to fill in the rows. They will need to use *moderate* amount of spatial planning in order the most effectively place the blocks.

### **Platform**
The game is developed to be released on Windows and Linux PC.

### **Development Software**
- Godot version 4.2.1
- Libresprite
- Whatever Omnivert is cooking with :-)
### Genres 
Puzzle, tile-matching

### Target Audience

Our version of the game is target for **casual audience**. We are more concerned about it being fun and easy to pick up rather then to fine balance the difficulty to match the player's skill.
